# WDNES
In progress NES emulator for Windows and web browsers.
 
## Long term goals
Build a working NES emulator with readable code, though I'm still far from both :sweat_smile: and explore new areas of development.

## Current TODOs
1. Improve debugging of MOS6502 and 2C02.
2. Add multiple input devices with custom key mapping.
3. Improve implementation of 2C02.
4. Setup scripts to build with emscripten.
