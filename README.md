# WDNES
Future NES emulator for Windows and web browsers.
 
## Long term goals
Build a working NES emulator with readable code, though I'm still far from both :sweat_smile: and explore new areas of development.

## TODOs
1. Improve debugging of MOS6502 and 2C02.
2. Fix scrolling (the initial lines of the nametables are weird).
3. Add input devices.
4. MOS6502 class: Improve MOS6502 class (fetch - decode - execute loop, encapsulation and inlined todos).
5. Add APU.
