# WDNES
Future NES emulator for Windows and web browsers.
 
## Long term goals
Build a working NES emulator with readable code, though I'm still far from both :sweat_smile: and explore new areas of development.

## TODOs
1. Fix background rendering for nestest.
3. Improve debugging of MOS6502 and 2C02.
4. Fix scrolling (the initial lines of the nametables are weird).
5. Add input devices.
6. MOS6502 class: Improve MOS6502 class (fetch - decode - execute loop, encapsulation and inlined todos).
7. Add APU.
